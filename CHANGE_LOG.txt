Reoriented. Wrote astrobase extension for make_eb_checkplot. It's running and
creating sane results. Next steps: do it on many fields.

Updates from the holidays:

02_retrieve_LCs_given_sqlitecurve_head.py:

Given a sqlitecurve "header" (csv file with hatid, twomassid, lcfpath, and ndet
from the HATNet/HATS data) 02_retrieve_LCs_given_sqlitecurve_head.py downloads
the sqlitecurve to /data/LCs/ from HAT servers.

03_find_LC_period_given_field.py:

For any specified DSP limit and HAT field, this program:
  i) copies BLS results from a run of HATpipe locally for processing
  ii) parses the blsanalsum.txt output files into smaller text files that meet
    the DSP limit. (And TODO: add other conditions to improve)
  iii) Matches these files (at data/HATpipe/blsanalsums/cuts) 
    (have HATID, ROWID, PERIOD, Q, EPOCH, SNR, DSP, NTR, OOTSIG.) with
    sqlitecurve file-IDs. Then creates a DEBiL-readable LC file with format:
    (time, mag, err). Takes ~1 sec per LC.
    Also creates a "DEBiL header" (a file required for DEBiL to read many LCs,
    that contains the extracted period-guesses)
  
UTIL_plot_DEBiL_LCs.py:
Given a field and DSP limit, plot the phased magnitude series (TODO: verify
magnitude normalization btwn observations works).

Adding "src/no_sqlitecurve" scripts. This is from 161221, before it became
clear that 2MASS IDs and associated LC lookup urls are already being
agglomerated by WB.

Made change log. Came back to project. Reorganized.
