========================================
Getting set up with Waqas:
The oldest data (pre-2007) has different columns and they have not been
merged to be compatible yet.

The data we will immediately play with is in:
/H/BIGPROJ/hatuser/2007_hatnet_phot.

The directories are sorted by field. E.g., G309 has 309 as a field number.
LC subdirectory means lightcurve.

The apertures were figured out by Kalo a while ago. They're _not_ explicitly
optimized by star b/c that introduces the problem of concatenating the light
curves of different stars w/ different apertures (that change depending on
observing conditions).
They go 1,2,3 where 1 is the smaller (~2px radius), and 3 is the biggest (~4px
radius).
Note HATN has big pixels: ~10"/px (vs. HATS ~5"/px).

Generic linux tips for the debian system the server runs on:
`apropos "string"` lets you find programs related to 'string'
`feh *` runs the feh program on all images in this folder

EFFECT OF APERTURE NUMBER ON LIGHT CURVE:
  * Small apertures(1): noisier for brighter stars, lower RMS for dim stars
  * Big apertures(3): lower RMS for bright stars, higher RMS for dim stars
-> they have a way of taking the bestaperture, *bestap*. 

Rough picture of data:
INSTR magnitudes: not at all corrected
EPD: _basic_ pass -- 1st order filter (sinusoidal fit over the whole timescale
  of the observation). Least sophisticated.
TFA: more sophisticated. Does what I originally though EPD did -- cross-correlates
  over differnet pixels and stars to remove instrumental systematics.
  However, TFA curves have a larger probability of being __overcorrected__ for
  actual viarables.

For EBs, Waqas recommends starting with EPD light curves.

Generically, for e.g. field G309, at r=10 where the precision peaks, EPD is around
5mmag (bestap), and TFA is around 3-4mmag.

To get stellar data:
  * hatsurveys.org/lightcurves
  --> N.b. each HAT object is cross-matched w/ a 2MASS catalog ID.

Possibly useful tools:
* VARTOOLS
* EB fitters?
* DFM's model comparison framework
* Whatever the Kepler EB team did!

========================================
Discussing w/ John Hoffman:
His variability project is big-picture: how do you classify __all variable events__
in the HAT data?
One approach that he's going down is some kind of machine learning neural network
that recognizes them as images (once phase-folded over the primary peak of a BLS
spectrum). The idea here is a big freakin **classifier**.

This is basically his thesis.
Started in quantum cosmology, realized he prefered machine learning / data analysis.

He also is a running a B-dwarf oscillation search on the side. Apparently their
flux variations (asteroseismic? or some kind of pulsations) are astrophysically
interesting.

========================================
From what Waqas is giving us, there's no EB flag. 
So step 1: identify some EBs.

Well, step 0: get actual access to the EPD / TFA corrected light curves.
Step 0.5: talk w/ Joel, see if he has an EB list collecting dust somewhere.
