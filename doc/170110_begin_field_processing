*? deal with things with 3 best periods being very close to 1day (e.g., 
  0.00095-1.0005, or its aliases) (perhaps not--seems not too common)

DSP of 30 seems like a good limit from G081.
----------

X see whether to follow Joel's advice on the cuts (Ntra, rather than a strict
  cut on periods)
  X in blsanal files:
  > Cut on NTR >= 3.
  > Cut on 1st and 2nd fields of NTV as >=6 and >=4.

X OR: rewrite procedure: do not download entire field. 
  Only download the files you NEED, rather than
  EVERYTHING. i.e. 
  
STEP 0: scp and parse BLS results for a given field (e.g., G081).
        make cuts by Ntra_min, NTV, and DSP_lim.
STEP 1: only download LCs that meet parsed requirements (all at once -> easier
        subseuent tuning of params)
        (Saves SHITTONS of disk space)

X put in selection against very-close-to-1day periods (and move them too)

X write a script to take an input file of field_ids, and then make
  `02_get_EB_checkplots` accept the input file, and just get the EB checkplots
  for every field.

  Run it as: ./get_EB_checkplot &

X Hide (by moving LCs) things with:
  X All top 5 peaks (from BLS and SPDM) > 30 days
  X If all peaks < 30d (from BLS and SPDM) are within 0.01day of a multiple of
    1 day

X incorporate all of waqas' new fields: (look at /LC subdir!)
  G115
  G133
  G160
  G248
  G389
  (ran at DSP_lim = 30)

X Impose better 1 day alias penalty:

  If, for the 3 highest peaks of BLS and SPDM spectra (all 6 of them),
  of the peaks below 30 days and above 0.502 days if 

    |peak values - 1| (mod 1) is within 0.01 days,

  throw it out.
  (E.g., 0.995, 2.006, 6.997, and the same next 3, would be thrown out)
  (E.g., 0.985, 2.006, 6.997, and the same next 3, would not be thrown out)

X Make ylims smaller on EB checkplots, helpful to catch smaller transits
  (likely go off standard devn once phase-folded... big detached EBs will be
  obvious, so another option: just lower conditions that already exist)

X incorporate GB's suggestions:
  X Lower DSP limit (to 20), rerun.
  * Match btwn BLS peaks and SPDM peaks should increase priority
  * Relation btwn max duration and period: it's a function of stellar type for
    planetary transits. For EBs, relation is less tight, b/c it depends on both
    stars, but can still be used to filter & avoid too-wide eclipses.

-> fixed. This was in the path locations.



* figure out the stellar header data (e.g. json file writing) thing!
  / incorporate Waqas' changes to astrobase (different way of calling the
  checkplot. Add option to turn off obnoxious green highlighting)
  --> how to also parse outputs.

* deal with neighboring stars that get the same periods (i
  think we have a check below)
  "" Search for entries with oribtal periods differeing by <0.1 days, and
  coordinates differing by <0.03 deg. Assign EB to star whose LC shows the deepest 
  eclipse event as would be expected when the photometric aperture is centered on 
  the EB. ""


----------

* check out ephem and sahara!
  -> period and transit ephemeris refinement tools.


* Implement 04. (Else: do an ephem-like analysis to improve period guess)

* After 03, rerun periodogram analysis to improve period. 
Create "check plots" per astrobase, w/ LS + analysis of variance + BLS.
(Include things like name of HAT object, 2MASS image)
Run a visual check search (per what `ephem` and `sahara` do) for the results
of given field, and classify visually into D/SD/OC/?.

* Wrap 00-04 to keep text file logs of what input params you use at command 
line.
