*? deal with things with 3 best periods being very close to 1day (e.g., 
  0.00095-1.0005, or its aliases) (perhaps not--seems not too common)

DSP of 30 seems like a good limit from G081.
----------

X see whether to follow Joel's advice on the cuts (Ntra, rather than a strict
  cut on periods)
  X in blsanal files:
  > Cut on NTR >= 3.
  > Cut on 1st and 2nd fields of NTV as >=6 and >=4.

X OR: rewrite procedure: do not download entire field. 
  Only download the files you NEED, rather than
  EVERYTHING. i.e. 
  
STEP 0: scp and parse BLS results for a given field (e.g., G081).
        make cuts by Ntra_min, NTV, and DSP_lim.
STEP 1: only download LCs that meet parsed requirements (all at once -> easier
        subseuent tuning of params)
        (Saves SHITTONS of disk space)

X put in selection against very-close-to-1day periods (and move them too)

X write a script to take an input file of field_ids, and then make
  `02_get_EB_checkplots` accept the input file, and just get the EB checkplots
  for every field.

  Run it as: ./get_EB_checkplot &

X Hide (by moving LCs) things with:
  X All top 5 peaks (from BLS and SPDM) > 30 days
  X If all peaks < 30d (from BLS and SPDM) are within 0.01day of a multiple of
    1 day

X incorporate all of waqas' new fields: (look at /LC subdir!)
  G115
  G133
  G160
  G248
  G389
  (ran at DSP_lim = 30)

* incorporate GB's suggestions:
  * Lower DSP limit

I'd also lower the DSP limit. And a match between the BLS peaks and SPDM peaks
should increase the priority. 
Also, there is a relation between max duration and period. This is a function
of stellar type for a planetary transit (not much dependent on the planet
radius, as that is typically << than the star). For EBs, the relation will be
less tight, as it depends on both stars, but can be used as a filter  to avoid
too wide eclipses.



* deal with neighboring stars that get the same periods (i
  think we have a check below)
  "" Search for entries with oribtal periods differeing by <0.1 days, and
  coordinates differing by <0.03 deg. Assign EB to star whose LC shows the deepest 
  eclipse event as would be expected when the photometric aperture is centered on 
  the EB. ""


----------

* check out ephem and sahara!
  -> period and transit ephemeris refinement tools.


* Implement 04. (Else: do an ephem-like analysis to improve period guess)

* After 03, rerun periodogram analysis to improve period. 
Create "check plots" per astrobase, w/ LS + analysis of variance + BLS.
(Include things like name of HAT object, 2MASS image)
Run a visual check search (per what `ephem` and `sahara` do) for the results
of given field, and classify visually into D/SD/OC/?.

* Wrap 00-04 to keep text file logs of what input params you use at command 
line.
