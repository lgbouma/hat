The pipe-dream is a rigorous CBP search. The cheap grab is finding all bright
EBs below some bright limit, running BLS on their EPD light curves, removing
the EB signal, and seeing what's left. (& If it's transit-candidate esque)

Over the next 2 weeks, we do the cheap grab.

==============================

EXERCISE:

I-i Kepler 16: did HAT observe any of the transits?
==========
* From Wikipedia, retrieved RA and dec of Kepler 16.
* From phn12 cmd line:

  > 2massread -r 19:16:18.17 -d 51:45:26.78 -s 0.005

Puts the relevant identifiers to stdout. But important questions: where is
this program? Who wrote it? How does it work? What are the columns?

Answers: In ~/HATpipebin/bin, the binaries from the HAT pipeline. These are 
generally tools built by contributors to the HAT project. If you wrote a tool,
you can use it freely. But they're not to be distributed to whoever, which
means (equivalently) that I shouldn't be hosting them willy-nilly on github.

For the source... harder to find. Emailed Waqas. Gaspar cc'd and got back to me
with source (& we'll talk copyright):

int fwrite_line(FILE *fw,char *ID_2mass,double ra,double dec,
    double xi,double eta,double ra_cen,double dec_cen,
    double J,double Junc,double H,double Hunc,double K,double Kunc,
    char *ph_qual,double B,double V,double R,double I,
    double u_sdss, double g_sdss, double r_sdss, double i_sdss,
    double z_sdss, int hatfield,int hatnum)

But REGARDLESS, we have the HAT ID:
HAT-115-0003266

* Now get the associated LC:

  > getfieldswithlc.sh HAT-115-0003266

The source for this shell script is (obviously) there. It looks thru all of
them (presumably), whatever drives they're mounted on. It's in:
/home/lbouma/HATpipebin/scripts/genutils_scr/getfieldswithlc.sh

  #/H/BIGPROJ/hatuser/2007_hatnet_phot/G115 HAT-115-0003266 
  LC/HAT-115-0003266.tfalc 9445 102 11.77690 0.00616 3

Means: it's only in field G-115. The LC has 9445 points. Likely 11.7 mag,
likely RMS of 0.00616 (0.6%).
(n.b.: 115 is a _tile number_, not a field number...)
(n.b. a careful reading of the output from 2massread had this)

  lbouma@phn12:/H/BIGPROJ/hatuser/2007_hatnet_phot/G115/BASE$ cat lcstat_tfa_merged.txt  | grep '0003266'
  HAT-115-0003266 LC/HAT-115-0003266.tfalc 9445 102 11.77690 0.00616 3

order of columns:
number of points in light curve
number of points excluded when calculated tfa stats
2mass base magnitude (optical) -- do not trust (doesn't matter!, but good to 0.1mag)
TFA-rms
suggested aperture

* Get all 9 LCs (different apertures + tfa vs epd vs raw. expect TFA to
  have removed the EB variability that we should see...) for Kepler 16

Well, field G257 has the LCs properly linked.
However, field G115 does not. Unclear why, but note /H/4KRED/AP/4KAP_LC/115
does not exist (however 257, for instance, does).

Emailed Waqas + Gaspar to get more info.

I-ii. Reframe the exercise: "let's look at an EB light curve" 
==========

Read: Paczynski, 2006, ASAS summary.
Eclipsing Detached vs Eclipsing Contact vs Eclipsing SemiDetached

Intro to contact binaries:
Contact binaries := W UMa stars (UMa: ursa major. W: Argelander scheme, T
Tauri, RR Lyrae, ZZ Ceti, etc.). They're in _physical contact_. Two components
are tidally distorted -> continous brightness change.
Lucy 1968: the envelope, shared btwn both components, has the same entropy,
thus Teff ~ const over the surface. q != 1, so the more massive component
generates more nuclear energy, which is distributed throughout the contact
binary in a thick convective envelope. In this sense, contact binaries are more
like "one star" than 2 separate stars. (B/c it's two cores sharing a convective
envelope!!)
M(R) for ZAMS stars is much steeper than for two Roche lobes. There is no
stable equilibrium btwn the two stars w/ a common envelope. The system evolves
thru a sequence of __relaxation oscillations__, with mass flowing from star A
to B, then from B to A, etc. The cycle repeats on a KH timescale.
In the thermal relaxation model, the binary oscillates btwn thermal contact, w/
two eclipses of almost equal depth, and a semi-detached phase in which one
eclipse is much deeper than another.

It isinteresting that there is a controversy about thermalrelaxation
oscillations in the W UMa systems. Some authors claim there are
no such oscillations (Webbink 2003), while others claim that such
oscillations exist (Quin 2003; Li, Han & Zhang 2004; Yakut &
Eggleton 2005, and references therein)

Dumb Q: could some contact binaries be star + HJ systems? Why not?
How would we know? What would we look for?

Close binaries: if there's a deep common envelope, then the binary is in
thermal contact and the eclipses are almost equal depth.
If the contact is shallow, or there's no physical contact, then Teff of the
stars is different, and the two eclipses have different depths.

"Theoretical models of relaxation oscillations indicate that the radii
of the two components change relatively little throughout the cycle
(Flannery 1976; Lucy 1976; Robertson & Eggleton 1977; Yakut &
Eggleton 2005, and references therein)"

...
Waqas notes: the above was b/c of a stale NFS mount, which has now been
remounted.
Go back to original exercise (although Paczynski paper was an interesting
aside).

I-iii. Back to Kepler 16 did HAT observe any of the transits?
==========
* Get all 9 LCs (different apertures + tfa vs epd vs raw. expect TFA to
  have removed the EB variability that we should see...) for Kepler 16

HAT-115-0003266.

On crispy, did:

  > scp lbouma@phn12:/H/4KRED/AP/4KAP_LC/115/HAT-115-0003266* .

Gives 3 LCs: tfalc, rlc, epdlc, and 1 file: epdlog.

Can I use Waqas' astrobase to plot these LCs? What about run period searches?

Reading through the source, looks like answer is: "yes, for sure, that's the
entire point".
--> cloend into /src/astrobase, installed.

* Let's run thru astrobase/notebooks/lightcurve-work.ipynb first, to get an
  idea for what's in the box.
(after lunch)

Tue 20 Dec 2016 01:19:11 PM EST

* astrobase/notebooks/lightcurve-work.ipynb

Ok, read through. Awesome. Can be easily paraphrased (probably) to our Kepler
16 example.




==========

* Reproduce what Joel did (cross-match, run the HAT tools)

* Did HAT observe any of the transits of the _other_ CBPs? (Most Î´ too small)


FIRST-STEPS:
* Pick a HAT field. Find what EBs are __known__ within that field (SIMBAD, ASAS
  North/South, other surveys...)
* Cross-correlating these EBs, use the already-computed BLS search and
  phase-fold on the period. Can I independently extract the period and
  ephemeris of the system?




==============================
SECOND-STEPS:
Once we get to EBs that are not readily available in catalogs:
* Select everything in a given HAT field with DSP > 9 (like a SNR, from BLS. 
  See paper. Use the outputs from HAT's already-computed BLS search!)

* ???
* Have identified EBs w/ orbital & physical parameters




==============================
(Possible publishable outcomes:
1 transiting CBP candidate isn't enough. you'd need confirmation, or more
interesting things than "one-event candidate"
(what if the SNR were super-high, a la microlensing events? Could an automated
search for such events be done on K2/Kepler data? -> TESS data?)

* BUT, "I looked at 20% of the northern sky, and here are 100 candidates,
  likely with 99% false alarms, you go do the followup"
OR
* Here's a bonafide CBP detection
OR
* Here's an EB catalog, w/ injection-recovery too.
* Here's an EB catalog, w/ statistics (observational paper, a la Paczynski 2006
  "EBs in the All Sky Automated Survey catalog"
OR
* Here's a COROT-analysis reproduction paper, w/ injection-recovery to estimate
  occurrence rate upper bounds.
