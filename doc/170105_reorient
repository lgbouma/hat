Goal: identify 10k reliable EBs (detached and bright) in the HAT data, by
  Jan 20. (Figure out the _method_ to do it, e.g., in one field of the ~150 in
  the HATNet data, by next Tues)

Adopt Prsa+2011 classification: D, SD, OC, ELV, and ?.
N.b. typical EB fractions from ground are 25% D, 25% SD, 50% OC.
Kepler EB catalog was ~50% D, 25% SD, 25% OC. (->~3k EBs->1.5k D-class).
So we need at least 5k D-class EBs for this to be interesting.

Phrased this way, reorient approaches:

-01. Query existing catalogs to get a big list of known EBs. Keep these lists for cross-matching with lists of stars surveyed by HATNet.
-> SIMBAD (query for morphological type, for δ>0. 20k max-> split into sub-declination groups).
-> ASAS-North (Pigulski 2008). Cataloged 1k variables in Kepler field, but no others. Directly using the Kepler EB list would be better.
-> GCVS catalog.
-> TRES catalog (Devor 2008)?
-> Kepler EB list

These are fine, but many will be too bright (-> saturation) or too faint for
HATNet precision. Querying the Kepler EB list is also a bit futile for
discovery, since their LCs are far more precise. Focus on the HAT data:

====================
00.  Pick a HAT field. 

01. Get a list of all HAT ID objects w/ sqlitecurves in that field (on which 
BLS has already been run thru the pipeline) + find corresponding 2MASS IDs.

02. Retrive LCs for these HAT objects. (expected size?)

03. Find the LC period (if it has one). Specifically, this means: look at the
five BLS peaks for each LC. (From what's already on phn12 in the blsanal
files). If DSP>CUTOFF (where CUTOFF could be, say, 10), then we saw that
particular LC has a strong enough periodic component to make it past the first
cut.

04. Search for entries with oribtal periods differeing by <0.1 days, and
coordinates differing by <0.03 deg. Assign EB to star whose LC shows the deepest 
eclipse event as would be expected when the photometric aperture is centered on 
the EB.

0X. `ephem`: computes 3 periodograms - LS, analysis of variance, and BLS. Program
has two panels: one for periodogram, other for phased LC. Dragging mouse over
periodogram modifies the period, allowed for quick tuning.

0X. `sahara`: visually inspect each LC, select by eye the primary and secondary
eclipses  

0X. Look at histogram of periods.

0X. Try PHOEBE 2.0 + emcee (_heavily_ documented + solid base)

0X. Try JKTEBOP + emcee. (Still detached-EB specialized, likely as fast b/c
modern and maintained)

0X. Try Stetson Variability Index on all filtered and unfiltered LCs (measure 
of correlated signal in a LC). (Christiansen+ 2008 claims good at long-P
variables)

0X. DEBiL (?). Nominally supposed to do this job. Not maintained. Not well
documented (or used).

0X. Write program that allows systematic visual EB classification

====================
TODO:

Where are ephem / sahara?
X email Prsa
* Friday afternoon: call Prsa (phone # online)

* Rerun 00-03 for new field. 
  X Edit scripts appropriately, e.g., giving them shell kwargs so that you can 
    bash-script them & later log input/output nicely). 
  X For "neighboring fields" functionality: do it field-by-field. Create some input 
    file with lists of neighboring fields.
  X modify sqlitecurve_matching_and_LC_processing function to be less DEBiL-centric.

  * (?) do we want to run our period refinement once we've done
  hatlc.read_and_filter_sqlitecurve, & the subsequent normalization?
  A: most likely. Once we have the LCs loaded we can just let loose
  with astrobase.
  -> to get the specific checkplots I want (w/ stellingwerf + LS + BLS), likely best 
  to just do it directly here. it's ~a few hundred per field with DSP>20.

  * further cut: only things for which 2 of the top 3 BLS peaks are > 1 day
  (we don't care about short-period binaries b/c they won't be detached -> have
  undergone crazy evolution -> are probably unlikely to host CBPs)

  * write relevant "checkplot" maker for EB-specific visual inspection (and
    contribute it to astrobase).

Use: DSP limit of 20. 

Details: 
blsanalsum.txt has 34,600 unique stars in '*-081*' field. (Very close
to what sqlitecurve_header has)

Note that /data/LCs is a staging ground. All of a given field's LCs can't stay 
there forever -- they're >~100Gb / field, depending on the field. So we cut
them, and keep the interesting ones in LC_cuts.
HOWEVER with our current approach this is not being done w/ sqlitecurves --
only the 3 columns of interest.
Done: fix.

Is it fine to just save em? OOM: 78Gb per 32k LCs (from field G081), so
In [6]: 78/32054. *1000
Out[6]: 2.433393648218631 Mb per sqlitecurve

In [7]: 78/32054. *50000
Out[7]: 121.66968241093154 Gb for storing 50k LCs with DSP>20 locally in
sqlitecurve format. 

This seems fine.

sigma clipping: `sigclip`. By default, they say:
  sigind = |finite mags - median_mag| < (sigclip * stddev_mag)                                                                                                                                           

Seems not helpful for EBs (where e.g. a 50% dip means a 0.75mag drop).
Just don't do any, and see how bad it is.

Ok, after implementing what seems like a semi-working thing:
* why are many of the BLS1 plots 1.000019 days??

* it's cranking at 3mins/plot.
  20plots/hr -> come back in 10-15hr, we'll have ~200-300 plots (unless DSP of
  40 is too big)

X PR the make_eb_checkplot changes

X figure out sigma clipping for the plots -- (or just fix the ylims to be
  whatever the median is, like plus 1 and minus 3 standard deviations or something
  (and at most 1 mag, since that's a >50% dip)

X BLS takes FOREVER. maybe just don't rerun it? or figure out how to make the
  spectrum less dense. or use the points that we already have from HATpipe

X we need to COPY (not MOVE) the _cut LCs (b/c what if we want to rerun, with a
  lower DSP cut?)
X move everything with all nbestperiods > 20d to some other folder (where we
  don't believe that they'll be detached EBs)

* figure out how to deal with neighboring stars that get the same periods (i
  think we have a check below)



* check out ephem and sahara!


* Implement 04. (Else: do an ephem-like analysis to improve period guess)

* After 03, rerun periodogram analysis to improve period. 
Create "check plots" per astrobase, w/ LS + analysis of variance + BLS.
(Include things like name of HAT object, 2MASS image)
Run a visual check search (per what `ephem` and `sahara` do) for the results
of given field, and classify visually into D/SD/OC/?.

* Wrap 00-04 to keep text file logs of what input params you use at command 
line.
