Well, step 0: get actual access to the EPD / TFA corrected light curves.
Step 0.5: talk w/ Joel, see if he has an EB list collecting dust somewhere.
So step 1: identify some EBs.

Recall: Hoffman said OOM ~6e6 LCs from HATN (not Gaspar's ~4e7)

========================================
# From Andrej Prsa's Kepler EB catalog paper (Kepler EB #1)

Notes:
* Q0 & Q1: 45d of Kepler data. 
* Kepler's EB occ rate: ~1.2%
* Existing EB catalogs:
  OGLE, MACHO, EROS, Hipparcos (astrometric+eclipsing, Perryman '97),
  other ground-based searches - Devor+ '08, Christianssen+ '08.
  Complex b/c of window functions.
* Kepler had no shutter -> would get smearing during readout
* Four times / yr Kepler rolled by 90deg to realign solar panels. This
  defines quarters. Q0: commissioning, Q1: ~35d first operation dataset, 
  b/c of launch date.
* Kepler pipeline is optimized to goal of finding earth-like planets.
  Presumably HAT's EPD and TFA are similar (although more TFA than EPD)
* How to ID EBs/transits w/ background contamination: during transits,
  expect the photocenter to move (requires good pointing accuracy)

Q's:
* Is Kepler 16 in this original catalog?
* what are different EB morphology types? physical meaning? impact on LC?
* how to compute fillout factor / sini for overcontacts?
* similar in finding parameters for detached binaries?
* what is HAT's EB occurrence rate?
* what is the focus of a telescope/camera, and why does it matter?
* when people quote "kepler has a f/1 primary" what does this mean?

Reading todo:
* Hartman+ '04, HAT's contribution to finding EBs for Kepler

How to ID EBs:
1. SIMBAD
2. All Sky Automated Survey - North / South (Pigulski+ '08?)
3. Automated transit detection -- via a pipeline.
    * Matched-filted correlation (Jenkins+ '96)
    * BLS, + use of FAP statistic
    -> i.e., perhaps do a transit search w/ VARTOOLS
4. Morphological classification of power spectra (confirms)
?. Once basic cuts are made, use periodogram tools for manual vetting --
    1) ephem: computes a BLS power spectrum, analysis of variance, & lomb-scargle.
    2) sahara: primary/second ID by click

Generally:
* People _specialize_ in EBs. E.g., check out __Hotwired__ conferences, in which
  you can see what people are actually doing, data-side.

Andrej's group makes software:
* PHOEBE: modelling code for physics of EBs
* EBAI: EBs via AI. Artificial neural network for rapid parameter estimation.
* polyfit: polynomial chain fitter for analytical approxns to light curves.

========================================
# Types of LCs available on phn12:

*rlc: raw light curves
*epdlc: external parameter decorrelated LCs
*tfalc: trend filter algorithm'd LCs
Other data:
*epdlog: how many stars are "rejected" vs "used" from running EPD?
  (why would running EPD reject or use things?)

Good fields to start with: G285, G284, G257.

? Why do some of the directories have data from OTHER FIELDS?
For instance, G284 has HAT-333-*.*lc data, as well as HAT-284-*.*lc data.
-> B/c they're numbering fields by TILE NUMBERS. (like, a healpix tiling
  scheme, perhaps). And the tiles have different shapes from the actual
  hat fields. This means that if you want to stitch all the LCs of a particular
  star, they won't be purely matched to the FIELD-ID.
  You'll need to search by the HAT-ID-NUMBER. (which is unique per star...
  I think)

? Why do we _store_ tfalc, epdlc, and rlc in different files? Seems quite
inefficient for space usage, since they're all formatted to have nans
before TFA / EPD correction is done. Why not just keep one thing? (you have
placeholder columns anyway)
-> so, kind of yes. Except that once TFA is run, apparently some extra rows
  are nan'd out (e.g. b/c of photometry quality flag)

? Why HAT-P-* as planet identifier?
-> A: yeah, it stands for planet. Original idea was that there'd be HAT-EB-*,
  there's a HAT-MEB somewhere

? Full explanation of columns? 
        col_names = ['KEY', 'OFIELD', 'BJDc', 'MRAW0', 'MRAWERR0', 'PHOTFLAG0',
                     'MRAW1', 'MRAWERR1', 'PHOTFLAG1', 'MRAW2', 'MRAWERR2', 'PHOTFLAG2',
                     'MFIT0', 'MFIT1', 'MFIT2', 'MEPD0', 'MEPD1', 'MEPD2', 'MTFA0', 'MTFA1',
                     'MTFA2', 'X', 'Y', 'BG', 'BGERR', 'S', 'D', 'K', 'HA', 'Z', 'JDc']
    Different apertures I basically get.
    Raw instrumental photometry.
    Vs "FIT" photometry (highest level of what's scientifically useable)
    Vs EPD photometry
    Vs TFA photometry
    X,Y position on CCDs.
    BGs presumably like a median or something of neighboring pixels
    S/D/K are shape parameters for the PSF (an ellipsoidal gaussian)
    HA: ?
    Z: ? (metallicity? eh, doubtful)
    JDc: reduced julian date (nice!)

--> probably use JDc and different apertures (e.g., EPD0 for dim stars, EPD2 for bright stars)
