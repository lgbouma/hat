# What if they're not prelabeled? (basically the case of EBs in HAT)

The `scikit_learn_cheatsheet` says: "you're trying to predict a category,
without labeled data, and you don't really know the number of categories of
objects you're looking for. The most basic analysis would be some kind of
_clustering_. If you keep it below 10k samples, it's possible you could try
`MeanShift` or `VBGMM`. If you want to go bigger than 10k samples, likely tough
luck".
"If you're willing to say that there are TWO categories (either is or is not
EB), with <10k samples could try `MiniBatch` or `KMeans`, else stick with
`KMeans`."

The field-knowledge (i.e. thinking about it from an astronomer's perspective)
says:

* Start by getting the field of HAT data. (Any field will be fine)
* Cross-correlate the HAT objects with other catalogs (2MASS, SDSS, etc). In
* particular, query SIMBAD or other databases to find what _known_ EBs are in
* that field.
* Look at the LCs for those EBs. Can you extract the basic periods from the BLS
* that has already been done? Can you phase-fold them? How does EPD vs TFA vs
* RAW affect the extraction?
* Only then get into deeper analysis. (I.e. field-specific and finding
* not-easily-cataloged EBs).
