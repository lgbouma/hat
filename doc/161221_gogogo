N.b. "???" is a flag to ask a HAT guru.
==========
00. Pick a HAT field. 
==========

Semi-arbitrarily, choose field 257.
Work locally in /hat/src (even ssh'ing data over. Working on HAT servers
will be a pain b/c no root access)

X Wrote 01_copy_fields_to_local.sh

Some objects in /G257/BLS have both .blsanal and .blsspec. What are these?
What are the difference? (Seems .blsanal has more of them -> for object ID,
we'll focus on .blsanal)

??? Ah. The things with .blsspec do not have any data in their .blsanal files.
Presumably something went wrong in their processing... BLS failed for some
reason?

Uh... copying G257 over, I'm getting 26Gb of data (and then I ran out of local
space). du -sh on the HAT server said it was 300Mb. wat.
Hah - oh. There are symlinks to like... really big drives of stuff (that
probably have their own symlinks to other drives, etc.

Try: only copying the data I need to have locally. So, then contents of the
G257/BLS/ directory. ls says 500Mb.

==========
01. Get a list of all HAT ID objects in that field (on which BLS has already been
run thru the pipeline) + find corresponding 2MASS IDs.
==========
Try using HAT LC server API!
No.
Try using astrobase!
Not immediately obvious. Might be in there, and Waqas certainly has a fast way,
What about "2massread" from the hat servers?
It's functional, i.e. 
  > 2massread -g HAT-211-0000016 
_works_, but IDK how (b/c no source, b/c gaspar is away) and it doesn't work 
locally (needs some aspects of server environment)

Options are:
1) ask waqas + gaspar, likely get pinned into using the hatnet surver tool.
2) just query the server.

Try (2) first.
Looks like the API isn't immediately pre-installed. We'll parse the html
that Waqas gives at https://hatsurveys.org/lightcurves/object/HAT-211-0000016
(and probably hit the query limit very quickly).

Ok, did it. And yes, there's this hard cap of 5k queries. Damn.

Ask Waqas:
There's a secret apikey that allows unlimited queries and returns in json and
is fast. (!) implemented. awesome.

Also learned how to run virtualenvs on hn12:
  source ~/py3venv/bin/activate
(& pip for all local user installs)

Ok, so have list, it's in data/intermed/02_G257_hatid_twomassid.out.

Now:
==========
Find what EBs are __known__ within that field (crossmatch with SIMBAD, ASAS 
North/South, other surveys...)
==========

ASAS-N has been observing since 2010, and no public DR yet.
ASAS-3 Catalog of Variable Stars: >10k EBs.

Downloaded ASAS-3 Catalog of Variable Stars from
http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/asas/data/ACVS.1.1.gz, 16/12/22 9am.

The columns are:
    ASAS-ID - ASAS identification (coded from the star's RA_2000 and DEC_2000 in
    the format: hhmmss+ddmm.m),
    P - period in days (or characteristic time scale of variation for irregular
    objects),
    T_0 - epoch of minimum (for eclipsing) or maximum (for pulsating) brightness,
    V_max - brightness at maximum,
    Amp_V - amplitude of variation,
    Type - one of the predefined classes: DSCT, RRC, RRAB, DCEP_FU, DCEP_FO, CW,
    ACV, BCEP, MIRA and MISC, or its combination,
    GCVS-ID - GCVS name,
    GCVS-Type - GCVS variability type,
    IR_12 - IRAS flux at 12 microns (listed as -2.5 log flux),
    IR_25 - IRAS flux at 25 microns
    IR_60 - IRAS flux at 60 microns
    IR_100 - IRAS flux at 100 microns
    J - 2MASS J photometry,
    H - 2MASS H photometry,
    K - 2MASS K photometry,
    V-IR_12 - color index,
    V-J - color index,
    V-H - color index,
    V-K - color index,
    J-H - color index,
    H-K - color index,

Note that 2MASS IDs are hhmmss.ss+ddmmss.s in 2000. So ASAS-IDs are like 2MASS
IDs, but lossier. >_<
However, noting that they include 2MASS J,H,K photometry, a likely path to get
the 2MASS IDs corresponding to the ASAS catalog is by doing a search based
on ASAS-ID (since the 2MASS ID is the same for the first 6, and can convert the
last  ones.

HOWEVER, ASAS-3 observes the sky SOUTH OF 28deg declination. Presumably, this
isn't great for HATN.

Well...
_Another_ approach would just be: replicate Hartman et al 2004. 

??? (n.b. the web link to Table 1 of that paper is broken)

Matching to known variables:
Hartman+ 2004 said: do the GCVS -- Combined General Catalog of Variable Sources
(Kholopov et al, 1998).
"""
We take a liberal
matching radius of 3000 to allow for matches to variables that
do not have 2MASS coordinates, as well as to allow for the
possibility that some of our variables are matched to the incorrect
2MASS counterpart. We also note that the positions in
the GCVS may come from a wide variety of epochs, further
necessitating the liberal matching radius
"""

Actually asking Waqas:
"GCVS is fine, but it's a bit old, and only really complete for the brightest
variable stars. HAT photometry might not actually be the best for them -- many
would be too bright. Since this is in the north, try the Kepler EB catalog.
Corresponding HAT fields are in a skymap to be emailed"

Cool.
Also, go thte catalog data from Hartman+ 2004.

This is a __great__ sanity check.

Ok. G199 was a so-so field.
Try neighboring fields: G154, G155, G198.
E.g., G154 should have Kepler EB catalog crossmatches.

JK, Waqas has sqlitecurve files for G199. These are big csv files with: hatid,
twomassid, lcfpath, and ndet. The "lcfpath" is a thing that can be used for
retrieving hatlc's from astrobase, via
http://data.hatsurveys.org/archive/{lcfpath}.

In other words, these sqlitecurve files, which exist for ~30% of the northern
sky surveyed by HATNet, make the code that I spent yesterday writing redundant
/ not necessary for the case of these ~30% of fields.

30% of the sky is certainly enough to make the fishing expedition worthwhile.

Also, chatted with Gaspar. He would like to meet _weekly_ (although not yet on
a clear schedule, let him know as it progresses). 

----------
OK, using G199.

Create 161222_restart_with_sqlite.
Move /src/01*, /src/02*, /src/03* scripts to /src/161221_no_sqlitecurves



* Cross-correlating these EBs, use the already-computed BLS search and
  phase-fold on the period. Independently extract the period and
  ephemeris of the system. Compare with Kepler EB catalog params.

==============================
SECOND-STEPS:
Get to EBs that are not readily available in catalogs:
* Select everything in given HAT field with DSP > 9 (like a SNR, from BLS. 
  See paper. Use the outputs from HAT's already-computed BLS search!)

  What to do to find eclipsing binaries:
  * 0. pick a field. Find what EBs are __known__ within that field (SIMBAD, ASAS North/South,
    other surveys...)
  * 1. use the outputs from HAT's already-computed BLS search! (or something along those lines)

  in e.g.:
  G155/BLS
  LOOK AT *.blsanal files! (don't need to rerun)
  SAVES THE TOP 5 BLS PEAKS FROM THEIR BLS ANALYSIS.

  frequency: in cycles/day (of that peak)
  period: 1/freq
  Q: fractional transit duration (Tdur/period)
  epoch: at the _start_ of transit (not the center)
  H: out-of-transit-magnitude for boxcar fit
  L: in-transit-magnitude
  Dip: H-L
  RESsig: ?. RMS of residuals?
  Dipsig: RMS of in-transit-points?

  --> apply selection criteria based on BLSanal files!! 

  Most useful columns:
  SR: signal residue. Defined in the BLS paper (not that useful, but in the paper)
    -> vertical axis on the bls spectrum
  SNR (look for high SNR)
  DSP: like a SNR. different defn.
  DSPR: slightly different defintion

  Another type of SNR (aside from phase-folding on the periods, then from phase-folded
  LC):
  * how pretty BLS spectrum is -- the peak height above scatter in BLS spectrum

  **Where are the differences _documented_?**
  In the pipelines!
  Description of pipeline:

  HATpipe/source
    compiled. C++, fortran.
    > lc/frontends directory: code for running BLS is here!
      `blsspec.c` creates the BLS spectrum.
    > lc/analyse
      `blsanal.c` 
      look for BLS_FIND_PEAKS, BLS_CALC_ANAL.

  HATpipe/scripts:
    shell, python, .. 

  ** CHOOSE THINGS ABOVE DSP OF 9 IN BLS FILES **
  (BLS picks up any variable thing -- astrophysical or not -- so there will be junk too)
  --> then will be applying a bunch of other filters.

  Things to check:
  * is the scatter inside and outside of transits different?
  * look for secondary eclipses (would indicate EBs)
  * look for large ampltiude transit variations
    (for transits, bad. for EBs, maybe good?)

  ========================================
  How to know what was done:
  in the G115/scripts files.

  Parts of the pipeline that identifies transit candidates from the BLS results:
  1. fold_x_gb_xv_inspect4.sh: first script in search for transit candidates
  2. doblsslcpostprocess.sh: second script run in transit candidate search

  ------------------------------
  So look at:
  blsanalsum.txt: has the BLS results for _every object in the field_

  gawk '$16 > 9 {print}' blsanalsum.txt | gawk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l

  Tells you: you have ~13k (out of 95k) that match this peak for a given field.



 

* Have identified EBs w/ orbital & physical parameters
