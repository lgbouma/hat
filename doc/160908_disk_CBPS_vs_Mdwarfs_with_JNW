For any proposed project,
At the end of the day, what will you have done to increase the sum of human knowledge?
Why will it be _useful_ to people?

Asking these questions inre: M dwarfs vs CBPs:
If after 1 year's work, you _find something_ (great!), will anyone care? Will people
say, "my, what a diligent student, doing their diligent work", or will your results
be useful to other people? Will they push other people's thinking further?


Another idea for a project:
Look at the Rp vs P diagram for HAT planets with:
  * high metallicities
  * vs low metallicities
(do the same for WASP planets)

Plays into the Santerne results
