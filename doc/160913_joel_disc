on phn12, important resource is:
/home/jhartman:

*See HATpipebin symlink (in Joel's folder):
  SVN repo for all hat-related tools.
--> it's also likely where anything that I write will get dumped (yeesh. Not much by way
  of structure, but I'm sure I'll figure it out better)

Raw flux: no zero-point, no corrections (subtracted off sky bkgnd)
  --> MRAW*
Fit magnitude: first order fit. (?? could use more clarity on what this means)
  --> MFIT*
EPD magnitudes:
  --> MEPD*
TFA magnitudes:
  --> MTFA


BE ON THE LOOK-OUT FOR FORMAT CHANGES: pre-2013 (give or take -- look at LC files)
--> columns change (need to read slightly differently)


General point for deep eclipses:
  * FIT LCs, or EPD LCs best direction. (don't use the TFA b/c it filters to hard
    in the direction of transiting planets, removing EB-esque variables)
  * the .tfalc files have CLIPPED the EPD outliers (e.g., deep eclipses, in EBs)

TIPS AND TRICKS:
**White space delimited for file reading** (relevant for any pandas reading)

====================
Useful shell functions, e.g. in Joel's home directory:

.func.hatuser
.alias.hatuser
.2massreadrc

--> all useful! (see everything i copied to joels_dot_files)

====================

EPD: fits against S/D/K (the parameters describing the PSF) (highest level)
* Can __distort__ LCs (for EBs).

TFA:
* removes 5sigma outliers from LCs!!
  -> SUPER important. this is for detecting transiting planets.
  (sigma defined from median deviation from median. So with e.g. 1% RMS, this
   means "if you're above 5% dip, we're not interested in you!")
* then it fits each LC as linear comb of ~800 light curves
  (done purely empircally. the idea is something like PCA, which is another
  thing I have yet to grok.)

* EBs at 5-10d periods tend to get _filtered_ by TFA!!
  (they remove low-frequency variability! since the LCs have ~1/f noise,
  they can usually find a lin combination of randomly sampled "basis vectors"
  that will remove it!)


========================================
OK: getting to CBP planet search.

You want __long baselines__ and HATN has some fields with long baselines. This is
quite useful (OOM) b/c you want to have multiple transits if you're going to have
any chance at detecting ~<1% transits.

EXERCISE:
Kepler 16: did HAT observe any of the transits?:
HAT-115-0003266
Their LC has 9000 points.
It's in field G115.

Did they see any transits?

To look up stars:
`2massread`: give it right ascension (sexadecimal or deg), -d declination,
  -s search radius in degrees.

`getfieldswithlc.sh` --> give it a HAT name.
(sometimes the same star falls into different fields)

(115 NOT field numbers. It's TILE numbers.)


in /G115/BASE/lcstat_tfa_merged.txt:
reverse order of columns:
suggested aperture
TFA-rms
2mass base magnitude (optical) -- do not trust (doesn't matter!, but good to 0.1mag)
number of points excluded when calculated tfa stats
number of points in light curve

========================================
What to do to find eclipsing binaries:
* 0. pick a field. Find what EBs are __known__ within that field (SIMBAD, ASAS North/South,
  other surveys...)
* 1. use the outputs from HAT's already-computed BLS search! (or something along those lines)

in e.g.:
G155/BLS
LOOK AT *.blsanal files! (don't need to rerun)
SAVES THE TOP 5 BLS PEAKS FROM THEIR BLS ANALYSIS.

frequency: in cycles/day (of that peak)
period: 1/freq
Q: fractional transit duration (Tdur/period)
epoch: at the _start_ of transit (not the center)
H: out-of-transit-magnitude for boxcar fit
L: in-transit-magnitude
Dip: H-L
RESsig: ?. RMS of residuals?
Dipsig: RMS of in-transit-points?

--> apply selection criteria based on BLSanal files!! 

Most useful columns:
SR: signal residue. Defined in the BLS paper (not that useful, but in the paper)
  -> vertical axis on the bls spectrum
SNR (look for high SNR)
DSP: like a SNR. different defn.
DSPR: slightly different defintion

Another type of SNR (aside from phase-folding on the periods, then from phase-folded
LC):
* how pretty BLS spectrum is -- the peak height above scatter in BLS spectrum

**Where are the differences _documented_?**
In the pipelines!
Description of pipeline:

HATpipe/source
  compiled. C++, fortran.
  > lc/frontends directory: code for running BLS is here!
    `blsspec.c` creates the BLS spectrum.
  > lc/analyse
    `blsanal.c` 
    look for BLS_FIND_PEAKS, BLS_CALC_ANAL.

HATpipe/scripts:
  shell, python, .. 

** CHOOSE THINGS ABOVE DSP OF 9 IN BLS FILES **
(BLS picks up any variable thing -- astrophysical or not -- so there will be junk too)
--> then will be applying a bunch of other filters.

Things to check:
* is the scatter inside and outside of transits different?
* look for secondary eclipses (would indicate EBs)
* look for large ampltiude transit variations
  (for transits, bad. for EBs, maybe good?)

========================================
How to know what was done:
in the G115/scripts files.

Parts of the pipeline that identifies transit candidates from the BLS results:
1. fold_x_gb_xv_inspect4.sh: first script in search for transit candidates
2. doblsslcpostprocess.sh: second script run in transit candidate search

------------------------------
So look at:
blsanalsum.txt: has the BLS results for _every object in the field_

gawk '$16 > 9 {print}' blsanalsum.txt | gawk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l

Tells you: you have ~13k (out of 95k) that match this peak for a given field.

==================================================
POSSIBLE PUBLISHABLE OUTCOMES:
* 1 transiting CBP candidate isn't enough. you'd need confirmation
* BUT, "I looked at 20% of the northern sky, and here are 100 candidates, likely with
  99% false alarms, you go do the followup"
