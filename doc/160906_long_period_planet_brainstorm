Perhaps this is a bad idea b/c single-transit precision is low. For HJ discoveries,
they're already phase-folding many 10s of transits to build a reasonable SNR.

What you'd be advocating for long-period jupiters is ~2-3 transits (over a baseline
of many years, ideally).

? Does HATN/S _have_ such long baseline data? The survey has been running for ~10yr,
but the fields are ~90deg^2.
  If all we have to work with is <~180d baseline data, might not be worth doing it
  this way.
  (HATS-17b)


Burke+ 2015 is _the_ reference for Rp<4Re planet occurrence statistics (or DFM thinks).
Did they talk about HJs? Could you do occurrence stats for HJs w/ the Kepler sample?
(are the metallicities well-known, at all?)


Another issue with this:
* Can't really do reliable population inference w/ HAT data. Their selections aren't
  systematic in the way the KOI list is.
* They also probably don't know their completeness very well(?)


Biggest picture:
HOW TO FIND SHORT-PERIOD TRANSITING EXOPLANETS
1) filter data to remove systematics
  (star, instrumental, weather, detector jitter...)
2) template-based grid of likelihoods
  (restricted to systems with >=3 transits)
3) remove false alarms of "visual inspection" OR
  use robotic (model comparison, like BIC) ways to rule out false alarms...

For (3), the reasons to quantify your biases include:
1) accurately computing planet occurrence rates
2) being able to reproduce your analysis


HOW TO FIND LONG-PERIOD TRANSITING EXOPLANETS
1) visual inspection
(Wang+ 2015, Uehara+ 2016, Kipping+ 2014,2016, Osborn+ 2016)

-> really doesn't let you be systematic, or know how complete/reliable your
search is, or how to quantify your false positive rates

OR fully-automated:
1) filted data to remove systematics
2) template-based grid of likelihoods (restricted to high SNR candidates)
3) remove false alarms using model comparison

astrophysical signal + star + weather + detector = signal

Use autodiff for plausible astrophysical signals:
  *U-shaped transit vs box-shaped transit vs step function vs straight
Use gaussian process regression for the star, weather, detector.

Then BIC to compare models!
