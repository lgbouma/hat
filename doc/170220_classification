Pawlak et al. (2016) ran BLS (vartools -- Joel's version -- it's _faster_) on
order(100k+) LCs from OGLE, and used the auxiliary parameters returned by BLS
(bls_auxiliaries.png in the notes) as features to train a random forest
classifier.

Really, it's pretty cut-and-dry classification, but the point is that it does a
much better job at siphoning through the first mega-barrage of crap (likely
down to weaker periodicities than what I'm currently searching).

Options:
1) emulate this random-forest classification approach based on features from
BLS.
2) random-forest classification, but using combination of features from BLS /
PDM.
3) self-organizing maps.
4) continue with visual for HAT identification purposes.
