Steps:
* Get phased EB LC. Subtract the EB signal
  (requires some interpolation to go back to original LC points).

* Now you have to search for planets. Options:

1) By eye. (takes forever, terrible SNR per transit. Likely infeasible)

2) Run BLS (issues: period btwn transits won't be same. Can have two or three
transits per conjunction, b/c the stars move fast. Between different
conjunctions, the planet orbital plane also precesses -- OOM of this effect?)

3) Run QATS (i.e. accept variable periods).

4) Implement CB-BLS (Aviv Ofir 2008).
"""Transiting circumbinary planets (CBP) produce transit signals that
are neither periodic not constant in duration or depth. These
complications contribute to the low number of detected transiting
CBP (nine published in total so far), and limited detection to
systems that exhibit transits that are relatively deep, i.e. giant
planets with individually-significant transit events. On the other
hand, planets around single stars taught us that small planets far
outnumber larger planets; consequently the ability to detect small
CBPs is of the essence in order to correctly describe CBP
demographics. Unfortunately, all currently known transiting CBP
were detected either by eye or by some ad-hoc technique that has
nothing to do with the 3-body dynamics of CBPs (e.g. QATS, Carter
& Agol 2013) limiting their detection power

CB-BLS (Ofir 2008) is an algorithm for the detection of transiting
CBPs that was proposed well before the first transiting CBP was
detected (Doyle et al 2011) but was unfortunately not used thus far.
CB-BLS was further evolved since its introduction; it is now
optimally sensitive and general, it can detect transit signals that are
not individually significant, and it has relatively well-understood
statistical properties that allow placing limits on non-detections. As
a test for its competence we show it to blindly detect all currently
known transiting CBPs, including these in eccentric and/or
inclined and/or very long planetary orbits that failed other
techniques.
We currently run a thorough search for CBPs in the Kepler dataset
using CB-BLS. On top of presenting CB-BLS and it capabilities, we
will give an update on the search's status and preliminary results.

4) Use EB transit durations to constrain interesting transit durations to search
thru LC. Bias search towards multiple-transits-per-conjunction objects (by
searching just for things that match a transit signal in those durations). Also
accept "high" (few-sigma) SNR single events, if there are many. Constrain
search to >few times EB period.
------------------------------

5) Generate CBP LC using EBOP (or a variant).
N.b. there's no well-maintained public code, AFAIK, that will generate a CBP
LC for you. However, the planet transits are just Mandel+Agol.
The star transits are Mandel&Agol, 1-(light blocked by transiting
object)+(light from transiting object), without relative radii assumptions.

Post-prototype of:
* get phased EB LC (by binning ~100 bins over the best SPDM peak), with an
injected planet
* reconstruct "model" EB LC by copy-pasting it over the observing
(non-homogeneous) times
* subtract "model" EB LC from data 
* rerun period search (for exactly periodic, huge planet)

Really we have two things:
1) get rid of EB signal
2) planet search in what remains

Comments:
* Bin over fewer phase points when constructing first model -- as-is, it's way
too noisy. (E.g. consider a ~50 point model, instead of the few-hundred that
you're currently doing)
> Risky. Bin too few, and you get  

* Write a routine to identify specific EB peaks in the observed data. (Physics
free).
Approach: once you have first model (from phase-folded LC), do something like
an "autocorrelation" (dot product btwn data & model at suspected peak), but
in the time domain rather than frequency.
This might just involve taking the first model, then shifting it around the
suspected peak (overlap btwn edges is OK), computing chi^2, and finding
whatever's smallest.

* When getting rid of EB signal, once EB transit times are identified, __throw
out__ the binary eclipses (both primary and secondary--- may be better with
separate models of each). 
In other words, do not show the data (and save this "residual" LC -- with the
primary and secondary binary eclipses thrown out -- in the pickles)

* Eventually for planet search:
- Best approaches likely visual and a "dip finder". (I.e. a hard-cut, or a few
hard-cut, boxes of whatever depth to "matched-filter" hunt for dips. Perhaps
then flag them different colors in LCs to be eye-vetted). OFC the idea here is
to not assume periodicity.

--------------------
X First, refactor prototype notebook to a proper program.
  X Debug it

* Write sub-routine (helper function) to identify all the transit peaks.
E.g. take "first model", then shift it around the suspected peak in time
domain. Produce autocorrelation function (something similar). Or compute chi^2.
Find whatever's smallest.

* Then throw out the binary eclipses. (Both primary and secondary. Might need
separate models of each?)

* Write dip-finder for residuals from planet search (no assumption of
periodicity reqd)
