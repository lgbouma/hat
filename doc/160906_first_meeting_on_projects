I opened with "big picture, I'd like to do data analysis"

We talked about 1) an M-dwarf focused search, 2) the long-period question,
3) variable stars, 4) short-period transiting planets, and 5) CBPs about EBs.

On long period planets: they have ~50d candidates. The problem with this as a
semester project idea is that it's much longer than a semester. It'd be something
to come back to in a year or 3, once it's transiting.
The Q of "what do you _do_ with them?" is the big thing. Obviously they're quite
an interesting topic, but the scope is also tricky.

The basic data they have: 4M light curves at <2% precision.

This is obviously enough to do interesting work on variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae,
delta-scuti), and there's already another student who's working on that as a
semester project.

The detrending they do: a Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA), and an External
Parameter Decorrelation (EPD). In other words they try to _leave_ astrophysical
variability in. Periodic oscillating stars can still be characterized -- there's
no fitting them out.

In terms of EB data then, if you were to search for CBPs the scope of the project
would be reasonably clear:
1) Take everything flagged as an EB in the HATS dataset
    (or do the flagging yourself if not already done)
2) Find periods for binaries to eclipse e/other (so that you have binary period).
3) Select so that 
    observing baseline >~ (binary period)*4 or 5.

  for many of these EBs, we're talking about a season (~4-5months) of southern
  summer data. The inner stability limit, at which these planets are expected to
  cluster, is typically this factor of 4 or 5.
  So if we don't have enough of a baseline, why would we keep the data?

  As another first cut, just based on "experience" from the Kepler data, throw
  away the pileup of P<1d binaries as well
  (as an extension / being more careful, might want to include these for surprising
  discovery potential)

  So if we have 1 season's data (120-150days), we're dealing with EBs of periods 
  1day-30/40days. Best sensitivity is at short periods, but more realistically
  we wouldn't expect much up to ~10d, at which point we're talking about like
  2, at best 3 transits per season.

  The _ideal_ case would be something like Kepler 47b, P_in=7.4d, P_p=50d.
  Literally the shortest period CBP currently known.
  There's also one (Kepler 413) with a 66.3d period.


* How common are EBs? (consider Kepler EB catalog papers, has HAT published?)
* How many EBs do they have, and what is the distribution for their baselines? 
  (I didn't really get a good answer from Gaspar on this, but the point is that 
  there might be a _few_ fields that have multiple seasons of observing, which
  would be quite important for what is basically a long-P planet search, with
  the added challenge of an extra source of stellar variability, + wonky 
  non-periodic transit times (QATS to the rescue? I think one of Agol's students
  is doing this).


ASIDE:
Possible project w/ Adam Burrows: figuring out what MORE you can learn from a 
planet transiting & being occulted by TWO stars. Especially w.r.t. transmission &
emission spectra: two different background sources basically gives you an extra
check on whatever features you see in the spectrum: are they truly from the planet,
or are they weirdly convolved with the stellar spectrum?


========================================
Obviously, the point right now is that I'm much more interested in & excited by
the prospect of working on something CBP-related.
This interest is still somewhat pragmatic: at minimum I'd want to say _something_
about a minimum planet occurrence rate for CBPs transtiting EBs at certain period
and radius ranges (i.e. by doing the search in a nice automated way).
I'd also like to FIND something.

If it turns out the baselines aren't good enough, or the RMS error on the light
curves makes recovery impossible, then... well then I'll need to try something
different.

This is in some sense a dream project though -- it's also the "in" I wanted to the
TESS CBP search front.


========================================
NEXT STEPS:
* Find updated info on status of HATS light curves. How long are the baselines,
  at what precision?
* How many EBs will they likely have?
   -> based, e.g., on Kepler EB statistics. (Get & read the EB working group's
    papers)
* What was the Kepler EB->CBP rate? (e.g. review Haghihipour's talk)
    Would *ANY* of these have been detected by a survey like HATS?
* How many will be at sufficient precision for single-transit detections?
* How many will be at sufficient precision for phase-folded detections?
* What would necessary properties of the CBP population _BE_ in order to expect
  _any_ CBPs in the HAT data?

* Should this be sufficient to detect CBPs based on Kepler data?
  (what was the thing I mentioned in my application?)

Getting into the data weeds:
* What are common CBP search methods? Uncommon ones?
* For instance... what would the necessary conditions be just on _eclipse timing_
  to constitute a bonafide CBP detection?
  (the literature on this is probably more scattered, & more oriented on heuristics
  to numerical N body orbit intergration)
