========================================
NEXT STEPS:
* Find updated info on status of HATS light curves. How long are the baselines,
  at what precision?
* How many EBs will they likely have?
   -> based, e.g., on Kepler EB statistics. (Get & read the EB working group's
    papers)
* What was the Kepler EB->CBP rate? (e.g. review Haghihipour's talk)
    Would *ANY* of these have been detected by a survey like HATS?
* How many will be at sufficient precision for single-transit detections?
* How many will be at sufficient precision for phase-folded detections?
* What would necessary properties of the CBP population _BE_ in order to expect
  _any_ CBPs in the HAT data?

* Should this be sufficient to detect CBPs based on Kepler data?
  (what was the thing I mentioned in my application?)

Getting into the data weeds:
* What are common CBP search methods? Uncommon ones?
* For instance... what would the necessary conditions be just on _eclipse timing_
  to constitute a bonafide CBP detection?
  (the literature on this is probably more scattered, & more oriented on heuristics
  to numerical N body orbit intergration)
