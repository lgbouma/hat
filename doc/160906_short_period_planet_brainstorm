Has HAT even run a FT-based analysis, rather than BLS?

Sanchis-Ojeda:
1) Run PDC-MAP (to remove instrument systematics; leaves astrophysical variability)
2) Stitch together light curves, calculate FT.
  Look for peaks above a certain SNR, require that you see at least one subharmonic.
  Only keep those that have no signs of stellar pulsations.
3) Period-folding analysis

The issue is obviously that you don't EXPECT to see anything big enough at
such short periods with lower precision photometry.
