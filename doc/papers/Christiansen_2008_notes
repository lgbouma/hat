Data a part of UNSW (Univ New South Wales) transiting exoplanet search.

Three methods to extract variable LCs from full data set:

i) visual inspection of filtered LCs down to 13th mag
- works for P<~5d. Harder when noisier.

ii) BLS analog on all filtered LCs down to 14th mag
- visually inspect LCs with SNR>8.
- not good for variable LCs with periods much shorter or longer than BLS window
  (e.g., 0.5-10d for them... similar for HATpipe?)

iii) implementation of Stetson Variability Index on entire set of filtered
and unfiltered LCs
- measure of correlated signal in a LC
- claim better at detecting long period variables
