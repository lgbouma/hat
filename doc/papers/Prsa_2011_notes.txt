Primary goal of Kepler: measure fraction of stars with rocky planets near 
their habitable zones.
Kepler "quarters": roll the spacecraft 4x/yr (every ~90 days). Q0+Q1: 43 
days of data (->1879 EBs).

Important approach for EB ID'ing: examine pixel row + column positions of the 
centroids of starlight.
Helps ID dilution & contamination of the EB: plot flux vs pixel position 
("rain plots").

Sources for known EBs:
* SIMBAD (query for morphological type, within a given field. E.g. our field 
  might just be the entire northern sky).
* ASAS-North (Pigulski 2008). Cataloged >1k variable in Kepler field.
* GCVS catalog.

Approaches for EB detection:
* Automated transit detection via matched-filter correlation (Mjaseth+ 2007). 
  Found 600 EBs in Kepler field from ground.

* From TPS, get ~10k threshold crossing events (>7.1σ). Then *go thru by eye*
  to get list of ~2680 new EB candidates. (Incl transits + eclipses). Then 
  remove exoplanet targets from EB target list.
  (N.b. ~30k seconds in an 8hr work day. Take 2 seconds per star->15k stars
  classified per day on this step).

* Via morphological classification of each LC's power spectrum.
  Detached systems: strong peak near 2x true Ω_orb. Then followed by a number
  of higher frequency harmonics at integer or half-integer ratios of the 
  primary frequency.
  Contact systems: only a few equally spaced strong harmonics.
  Good at finding EBs with strong features; worse as eclipses become shallower.

* Paczynski+ 2006: ASAS study. Classify 11099 EBs into detached, SD, or OC
  based on their respective domains in the cross-sections of Fourrier
  coeficients c2 and c4.
  -> get ~25% detached, 25% SD, 50% OC.

* Christiansen+ 2008: 850 variable in Kepler field. Method?

Tools:
* `ephem`: computes 3 periodograms - LS, analysis of variance, and BLS. Program
  has two panels: one for periodogram, other for phased LC. Dragging mouse over
  periodogram modifies the period, allowed for quick tuning.
* `sahara`: visually inspect each LC, select by eye the primary and secondary
  eclipses  
----BOTH AVAILABLE AT http://phoebe.fiz.uni-lj.si----

Procedural cuts:
* Search for entires with oribtal periods differeing by <0.1 days, and
  coordinates differing by <0.03 deg.
  Then assign EB to star whose LC shows the deepest eclipse event as ould be
  expected when the photometric aperture is centered on the EB.

Approach to EB classification:
* 5 groups: Detached (D), semi-detached (SD), overcontact (OC), ellipsoidal
  (ELV), and uncertain (?).
  Preliminary classifcation: VISUAL INSPECTION.
  Difficulties: distinguishing overcontact & ellipsoidal variables (both
  sinusoidal and shallow minima).
  But find: ~50% detached, 7.5% SD, 25% OC, 7.5% ellipsoidal, and 7.5% uncertain.
  (N.b. far more detached than from the ground-- ground is BIASED)

Automatic / statisical classification:
* EBAI: Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence (Prsa+ 2008). Trained
  two different classifiers. 1 for D/SD, other for OC.
  (Different principal parameters for each. For D/SD: T2/T1, ρ1+ρ2, esinω,
  ecosω, sini).
  Train it on a synthetic sample of 10k stars generated by LC synthesis code
  PHOEBE.
