3 sites: LCO in Chile. HESS in Namibia. SSO in Australia. 
Each site has 2 systems.
Each system has 4 180-mm (18cm) aperture f/2.8 (??) astrographs attached
to large-format CCDs, with a system FoV of 8.2deg*8.2deg at ~4arcsec/px.
They observe 8 < r < 14 stars at 4-minute cadence.

? are these systems used to overlap (i.e. continuous coverage), or are
  they used to get most sky?

Wide separation in longitude allows near-continuous monitoring of select
fields during the southern summer months (why not winter?) which makes
a big difference for phase coverage -> easier to rule out false-positives.

? how good is their phase coverage?

Highlights:
* Saturn-mass planet about an M-dwarf (HATS-6b)
* Longest orbital period transiting planet discovered from the ground (HATS-17b)
  (P=16.25d, Rp=0.78Rj, Mp=1.34Mj)

K2 C7 field overlapped w/ a HATS field, HS G579, which they obsd at 4min cadence
with 3 systems at 4 minute cadence.
HATS extracted light curve for 320k stars in the field, with a median of 10,100
r-band light curve points per object.
(~40k minutes, which is 27.8 days of continuous coverage... from Sep 2009 to Aug
2011?! 5% phase coverage? what?)

Detrended raw light curves w/ EPD and TFA algorithms --> high quality light curves
for ~250k stars. Unbinned precision 6 mmag at r~12mag.

? what are EPD and TFA algorithms?

63 exoplanet transit candidates
4 confirmed planets

Extend the time baseline for the K2.7 observations of overlapping objects
(n.b. HATS has much smaller pixels than e.g. TESS, but similar to K2), and also
allow ID'ing variable objects in and near the K2 object stamps.

DATA IS AT:
>>  data.hatsurveys.org

This data server will be the central point of where public HATS data and light
curves will be distributed. They'll also serve data from HATN and K2 that have
been reduced using HAT tools and methods (Chelsea Huang's paper / thesis 2015).
