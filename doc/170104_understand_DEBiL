TODO:

UTIL_plot_DEBiL_LCs.py:
X verify magnitude normalization btwn observations works (or does this need to
happen in preprocessing?)

--> no, it wasn't happening.So I added it in 03_find_LC_period_given_field.py
(using astrobase's function)

DEBiL:
* Rerun given properly normalized LCs

* What EBs did we run it on that it failed?

* What is the EB that gave us some output?

* What is the output format?

N.b. on LC flags:
'G' good, 'C' caution, 'X' bad









========================================

==========
0X. Look at JKTEBOP (Southworth). This is a code for more detailed fitting of
detached EB LCs.
==========



==========
0X. Find what EBs are __known__ within that field from the Kepler EB catalog. 
Also possible: SIMBAD, GCVS (latter two likely not).
==========
* Download Kepler EB catalog.
  Want: twomassids, periods, 2mass magnitudes (as independent check on xmatch)
* Crossmatch the twomassids.

==========
0X. Cross-correlating these EBs, use the already-computed BLS search and
phase-fold on the period. Independently extract the period and
ephemeris of the system. Compare with Kepler EB catalog params.
==========
























============================================================

SECOND-STEPS:
Get to EBs that are not readily available in catalogs:
* Select everything in given HAT field with DSP > 9 (like a SNR, from BLS. 
  See paper. Use the outputs from HAT's already-computed BLS search!)

  What to do to find eclipsing binaries:
  * 0. pick a field. Find what EBs are __known__ within that field (SIMBAD, ASAS North/South,
    other surveys...)
  * 1. use the outputs from HAT's already-computed BLS search! (or something along those lines)

  in e.g.:
  G155/BLS
  LOOK AT *.blsanal files! (don't need to rerun)
  SAVES THE TOP 5 BLS PEAKS FROM THEIR BLS ANALYSIS.

  frequency: in cycles/day (of that peak)
  period: 1/freq
  Q: fractional transit duration (Tdur/period)
  epoch: at the _start_ of transit (not the center)
  H: out-of-transit-magnitude for boxcar fit
  L: in-transit-magnitude
  Dip: H-L
  RESsig: ?. RMS of residuals?
  Dipsig: RMS of in-transit-points?

  --> apply selection criteria based on BLSanal files!! 

  Most useful columns:
  SR: signal residue. Defined in the BLS paper (not that useful, but in the paper)
    -> vertical axis on the bls spectrum
  SNR (look for high SNR)
  DSP: like a SNR. different defn.
  DSPR: slightly different defintion

  Another type of SNR (aside from phase-folding on the periods, then from phase-folded
  LC):
  * how pretty BLS spectrum is -- the peak height above scatter in BLS spectrum

  **Where are the differences _documented_?**
  In the pipelines!
  Description of pipeline:

  HATpipe/source
    compiled. C++, fortran.
    > lc/frontends directory: code for running BLS is here!
      `blsspec.c` creates the BLS spectrum.
    > lc/analyse
      `blsanal.c` 
      look for BLS_FIND_PEAKS, BLS_CALC_ANAL.

  HATpipe/scripts:
    shell, python, .. 

  ** CHOOSE THINGS ABOVE DSP OF 9 IN BLS FILES **
  (BLS picks up any variable thing -- astrophysical or not -- so there will be junk too)
  --> then will be applying a bunch of other filters.

  Things to check:
  * is the scatter inside and outside of transits different?
  * look for secondary eclipses (would indicate EBs)
  * look for large ampltiude transit variations
    (for transits, bad. for EBs, maybe good?)

  ========================================
  How to know what was done:
  in the G115/scripts files.

  Parts of the pipeline that identifies transit candidates from the BLS results:
  1. fold_x_gb_xv_inspect4.sh: first script in search for transit candidates
  2. doblsslcpostprocess.sh: second script run in transit candidate search

  ------------------------------
  So look at:
  blsanalsum.txt: has the BLS results for _every object in the field_

  gawk '$16 > 9 {print}' blsanalsum.txt | gawk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l

  Tells you: you have ~13k (out of 95k) that match this peak for a given field.



 

* Have identified EBs w/ orbital & physical parameters

Long period transiting planet search a la DFM style might be a necessary approach for
a transit search for CBPs in HAT data (after preliminary cuts).
Same in TESS data.
