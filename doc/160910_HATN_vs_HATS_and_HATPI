Record to date:
HATNet (2003 - ) (13 yr):
  * 58 exoplanets to date.
  * 2-station network. ~50 HAT planets are ~1/4th of known population w/ <10% mass determinations.
  * Locations: Whipple Obs, AZ. And submillimeter array (SMA) in Hawaii.
  * Connection btwn HATN & Kepler: HATN obsns prior to Kepler's launch gave 2 confirmed planets in
  Kepler's field: HAT-P-7b, the first HJ on a retrograde orbit, and HAT-P-11b, the first transiting
  Neptune discovered from the ground.
  * From _simultaneous_ observations: HAT search algorithms were "trained" to maximize recovery
  of real transits, and minimize # of false alarms.
  * HAT-P-1b: received Aug 2006 (3yrs after "start").

HATSouth (2009 - ) (7 yr):
  35 exoplanets to date.

HAT-PI (2016 - ) (active development).
